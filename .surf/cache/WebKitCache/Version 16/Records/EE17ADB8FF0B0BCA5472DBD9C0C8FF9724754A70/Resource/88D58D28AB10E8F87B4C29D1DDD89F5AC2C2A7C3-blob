When you connect via SSH, you authenticate using a private key file on your local machine. For more information about SSH, see <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Secure_Shell\">Secure Shell</a> on Wikipedia.</p>\n<p>When you set up SSH, you will need to generate a new private SSH key and add it to the SSH agent. You must also add the public SSH key to your account on GitHub before you use the key to authenticate or sign commits. For more information, see \"<a href=\"/en/authentication/connecting-to-github-with-ssh/generating-a-new-ssh-key-and-adding-it-to-the-ssh-agent\" _originalHref=\"/authentication/connecting-to-github-with-ssh/generating-a-new-ssh-key-and-adding-it-to-the-ssh-agent\">Generating a new SSH key and adding it to the ssh-agent</a>\",  \"<a href=\"/en/authentication/connecting-to-github-with-ssh/adding-a-new-ssh-key-to-your-github-account\" _originalHref=\"/authentication/connecting-to-github-with-ssh/adding-a-new-ssh-key-to-your-github-account\">Adding a new SSH key to your GitHub account</a>\" and \"<a href=\"/en/authentication/managing-commit-signature-verification/about-commit-signature-verification\" _originalHref=\"/authentication/managing-commit-signature-verification/about-commit-signature-verification\">About commit signature verification</a>.\"</p>\n<p>You can further secure your SSH key by using a hardware security key, which requires the physical hardware security key to be attached to your computer when the key pair is used to authenticate with SSH. You can also secure your SSH key by adding your key to the ssh-agent and using a passphrase. For more information, see \"<a href=\"/en/authentication/connecting-to-github-with-ssh/working-with-ssh-key-passphrases\" _originalHref=\"/authentication/connecting-to-github-with-ssh/working-with-ssh-key-passphrases\">Working with SSH key passphrases</a>.\"</p>\n<p>To use your SSH key with a repository owned by an organization that uses SAML single sign-on, you must authorize the key.

For more information, see \"<a href=\"/en/authentication/keeping-your-account-and-data-secure/reviewing-your-ssh-keys\" _originalHref=\"/authentication/keeping-your-account-and-data-secure/reviewing-your-ssh-keys\">Reviewing your SSH keys</a>.\"</p>\n<p>If you haven't used your SSH key for a year, then GitHub will automatically delete your inactive SSH key as a security precaution.
